# Proposed entry for github/linguist languages.yml
# See: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-language
#
# Notes:
# - language_id will be generated by running `script/update-ids` in the linguist repo
# - tm_scope matches the scopeName in vscode-hew (syntaxes/hew.tmLanguage.json)
# - ace_mode "text" is standard for languages without Ace editor support
# - color #06b6d4 is cyan-500, matching Hew's brand identity

  color: "#06b6d4"
  extensions:
